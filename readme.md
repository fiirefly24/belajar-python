# Hi there! 👋

You might be wondering how you ended up here, but here's a little about me.

I'm **Fikri**, and I'm currently learning **Python**. My goal is to become a **backend developer**, and I'm actively working towards that. I'm passionate about coding and excited to build my skills as I continue on this journey.

One of the key resources that's helped me get started is the **BroCode** YouTube channel, specifically their [**Python Full Course for free 🐍 (2024)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0). A huge thanks to BroCode for sharing this **free** course—it’s been an incredible way to dive into Python and start my backend development journey!

### 🚀 What I'm working on:
- Learning **Python** and improving my skills.
- ⏳ Exploring **backend development** concepts and technologies.
- ⏳ Building small projects to practice what I've learned.

Feel free to check out this repository and see what I’m working on. Let’s learn and grow together!
