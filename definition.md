# DEFINITIONS
## Variable
    Variable is a named storage location that holds a value.
        Name: A unique identifier for the variable.
        Value: The data stored in the variable.
        Data type: The type of data the variable can hold (e.g., integer, string, boolean).

## Type Casting
    Type Casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another
    e.g., str(), int(), float(), bool()

## Input Data
    input() is a function that prompts the user to enter data
    Returns the entered data as a String

## if
    Do some code only IF some condition is True
    Else do something else

## Logical Operators
    Evaluate multiple conditions (or, and, not)
    or = at least one condition must be true
    and = both condistion must be true
    not = inverts the condition (not false, not true)

## Conditional expression
    A one-line shortcut for the if-else statement (ternary operator)
    Print or assign one of two values based on a condition
    X if condition else Y

## String Method
    Built-in functions that allow you to perform various operations on strings

# ANY TIPS
## print(f{variable})
    use f in print so we can call the variable inside the quotes.
    ex. print(f"{name}") it has the same result as print(name)

## str to int
    if the string contains non-numerical characters, it will not be converted to an integer.

## operation float and int
    it is possible to multiply a float by an integer in math. When a float is multiplied by an integer, the result is a float.

## Import Math
    import module, making its functions and constants available for use

## uses of equals
    a single equals sign (=) is used for assignment value
    a double equals sign (==) is used for equality comparison.

## str.find() not found
    if the substring is not found, whereas find() just returns -1.
