# DEFINITIONS
## Variable
    Variable is a named storage location that holds a value.
        Name: A unique identifier for the variable.
        Value: The data stored in the variable.
        Data type: The type of data the variable can hold (e.g., integer, string, boolean).

# ANY TIPS
## print(f{variable})
    use f in print so we can call the variable inside the quotes.
    ex. print(f"{name}") it has the same result as print(name)
