# DEFINITIONS
## Variable
    Variable is a named storage location that holds a value.
        Name: A unique identifier for the variable.
        Value: The data stored in the variable.
        Data type: The type of data the variable can hold (e.g., integer, string, boolean).

## Type Casting
    Type Casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another
    e.g., str(), int(), float(), bool()

# ANY TIPS
## print(f{variable})
    use f in print so we can call the variable inside the quotes.
    ex. print(f"{name}") it has the same result as print(name)

## str to int
    if the string contains non-numerical characters, it will not be converted to an integer.
